# Use cases

## **Governance**

$ROSA is the symbol of your voice within the Rosa Finance DAO. As a $ROSA holder, you have the influential power to actively contribute to the governance process and shape the evolution of the platform. This includes proposing, discussing, and voting on critical proposals that define the strategic direction, functionalities, and enhancements of the platform. Your voting weight is carefully balanced with your token holdings, ensuring a democratic and proportional representation in the decision-making process. Rosa Finance encourages this dynamic governance as an embodiment of decentralized ethos, where every voice counts, every vote matters.

## **Platform Revenue Share**

Rosa Finance recognizes and rewards the commitment and trust of $ROSA holders by offering a unique opportunity to share in the platform's revenue. By staking your $ROSA tokens, you become eligible to earn a proportional share of the fees generated across the Rosa Finance ecosystem.

### **Staking**

With the introduction of stROSA, Rosa Finance's staking derivative, staking becomes an empowering and transparent process. The more you stake, the more you earn, both in ROSA and CHR tokens, aligning your interests with the long-term success of the platform. The Rosa staking mechanism is thoughtfully designed to encourage active participation, ensuring consistent rewards and fostering a sustainable and robust staking ecosystem.

### **Revenue Distribution**

As part of the rewards, stakers receive a share of protocol revenue, encompassing assets supported by Rosa Finance. This creates a continual buying pressure for ROSA and builds a direct connection between the stakers and the platform's performance. It's not just about staking; it's about being a part of Rosa Finance's success, a success that is transparently and equitably shared.

## **Strategic Engagement: Leveraging the Ecosystem**

The strategic collaboration with Chronos and active participation in its bribe marketplace adds a new dimension to the $ROSA use-case. Through liquidity provisioning (LPing) on Chronos, Rosa Finance enhances liquidity and protocol profitability. This increased revenue flows back to stROSA holders, ensuring a higher reward yield and establishing a win-win partnership within the broader decentralized finance landscape.

### **Bribes: A Transparent Incentive Mechanism**

Bribes on Chronos signify Rosa Finance's transparent engagement within the DeFi ecosystem. This approach not only enriches the ROSA/USDC pool but also increases the overall protocol revenue, creating an economic synergy that benefits all $ROSA holders and stakers.

## **Sustainability and Growth: A Commitment to the Future**

Rosa Finance's deliberate emission schedule and careful allocation of ROSA tokens underscore a dedication to sustainable growth. From incentivizing suppliers and borrowers to fostering early adoption, the thoughtful structure of rewards sets a trajectory for growth that's not just rapid but resilient. $ROSA is not just an investment in a platform; it's an investment in a vision, in a future where decentralized finance is not a concept but a thriving reality.
